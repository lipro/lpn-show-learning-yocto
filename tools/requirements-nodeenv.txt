#
# A high-quality PDF exporter for HTML presentation frameworks.
#
# DeckTape is built on top of Puppeteer which relies on Google Chrome
# for laying out and rendering Web pages and provides a headless Chrome
# instance scriptable with a JavaScript API. DeckTape currently supports
# several presentation frameworks out of the box. DeckTape also provides
# a generic command that works by emulating the end-user interaction,
# allowing it to be used to convert presentations from virtually any
# kind of framework. The generic mode is particularly useful for
# supporting HTML presentation frameworks that donâ€™t expose an API or
# accessible state.
