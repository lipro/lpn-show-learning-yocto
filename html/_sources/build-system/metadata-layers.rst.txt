   :ref:`Metadata Layers <ypdoc:overview-manual/concepts:metadata,
   machine configuration, and policy configuration>`
   as part of Yocto Build System Workflow

The previous area will be used to define BitBakeâ€™s global behavior. This
area takes a closer look at the layers the build system uses to further
control the build. These layers provide Metadata for the software, machine,
and policies. See :doc:`/metadata-layers/index` for more details.
