   :class: important

   #. Itâ€™s not an embedded Linux distribution |nbsp| |--| |nbsp|
      it creates a custom one for you.
   #. It is an Ecosystem.

   The Yocto Project combines the convenience of a ready-to-run Linux
   Distribution with the flexibility of a custom Linux operating system
   stack. :cite:`streif2015introyp,osiermixonmcgrath2015ypembos`
