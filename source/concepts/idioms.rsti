   #. :strong:`Build System`:
      The build system specific to the Yocto Project based on the project
      :strong:`Poky`, which uses :strong:`BitBake` as the :strong:`Task`
      executor.

   #. :strong:`Source Directory`:
      Refers to the directory structure created as a result of creating a
      local copy of the :strong:`Poky` and all other Git repositories as
      referred by the :strong:`Git Repo` manifest. It contains :strong:`BitBake`,
      Documentation, :strong:`Metadata` and other files that all support the
      Yocto Project. Consequently, you must have the :strong:`Source Directory`
      in place on your development system in order to do any development using
      the Yocto Project.
      |CRT| :term:`ypdoc:Source Directory`

   #. :strong:`Build Directory`:
      This term refers to the area used by the :strong:`Build System` for
      downloads, builds and deployments.
      |CRT| :term:`ypdoc:Build Directory`

   #. :strong:`Cross-Development Toolchain`:
      A collection of cross-compilers, linkers, debuggers, libraries and
      utilities that run on one architecture and allow you to develop
      software for a different, or targeted, architecture.
      |CRT| :term:`ypdoc:Cross-Development Toolchain`

   #. :strong:`Board Support Package (BSP)`:
      A group of drivers, definitions, and other components that provide
      support for a specific hardware configuration.
      |CRT| :term:`ypdoc:Board Support Package (BSP)`, or
